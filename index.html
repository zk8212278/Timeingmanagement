    <h1 class="main">Time Managment Point</h1>

    <h2>1. Pomodoro Technique</h2> 
    <p> Work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This technique can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.</p>

    <h2>2. Time Boxing</h2>
     <p> Schedule fixed, uninterrupted blocks of time for tasks. This helps prioritize tasks, avoid multitasking, and make realistic estimates.</p>

<h2>3. Avoid Context Switching</h2> 
<p>Minimize switching between tasks or projects. Context switching can decrease productivity by up to 40%. Try to complete tasks in a single session or limit switches to reduce overhead.</p>

<h2>4. Use a "Stop Doing" List</h2>
 <p> Identify tasks, meetings, or activities that consume time without adding value. Eliminate or delegate them to free up time for high-priority tasks.</p>

<h2>5. Schedule "White Space"</h2> 
<p> Leave buffer time between tasks or meetings for relaxation, learning, or unexpected tasks. This helps reduce stress, increases productivity, and allows for flexibility.</p>
